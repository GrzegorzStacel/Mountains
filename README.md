## General info
The project was created as a training and was aimed at eliminating the tedious, manual addition of points on images, e.g. on a page www.bellazone.pl

Just click on the area of interest, add a name and / or link and press the 'dodaj pozycje' button.
JSON code will be generated, which we can copy to our project.

*I did not implement RWD on the website because no developer writes code on a tablet or mobile :)

## Status
Project is: _no longer continue_ 
The project was only part of the training and I do not see the need to extend it with further facilities

## Inspiration
